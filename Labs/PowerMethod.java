/* Write a program with a method that calculates a power â€” a base number raised to the power of an
exponent. The method should take two parameters: a double (the base) and an int (the
exponent). The method should return a double: the base raised to the power of the exponent. In
the main() method, prompt the user to enter the base and the exponent; use the method to
perform the calculation; then print the result returned by the method. */
